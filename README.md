<p align="center">
  <samp>
    I am Nawaf Altuwairiqi, a Full Stack Developer in training and a senior Computer Science student. I began my programming journey in 2022, driven by a passion to understand how systems work from the ground up. <br><br>
    Through a structured roadmap, I developed strong backend skills and built a solid foundation in logical thinking by solving over 1500 coding challenges. My journey has enabled me to build complete applications from scratch â€” and Iâ€™m still growing. I continue to develop daily, building real-world projects and expanding my technical toolkit.
