<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

<p align="center">
  I am Nawaf Altuwairiqi, a Full Stack Developer in training and a senior Computer Science student. I began my programming journey in 2022, driven by a strong desire to understand how systems work from the ground up.
  <br><br>
  Through a structured roadmap, I developed solid backend skills and built a strong foundation in logical thinking by solving over 1500 coding challenges. This journey has enabled me to develop complete software solutions from scratch, and I continue to grow by working daily on real-world programming projects.
